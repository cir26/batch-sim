Class to assist in simulating Nylon-6 production

This project is split into 6 modules including:
Enthalpy - functions defined for enthalpy calculations.
Thermo - functions defined for thermodynamic phase equilibrium calculations.
Kinetics - functions defined for reaction kinetics calculations.
Calculations - Post-simulation calculations can be found here (molecular weight averages, polymer mass, system net enthalpy, etc).
Reactor_Sim - MAIN module used for setting reaction conditions and running simulation with suggested plots.
Plots - other plots explored can be found here.


To run a simulation execute Reactor_Sim.py.
To change reactor conditions edit Reactor_Sim.py starting at line 145.
Suggested plots are included in Reactor_Sim starting at line 177.
